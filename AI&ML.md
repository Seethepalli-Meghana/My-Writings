##  What is Machine Learning?  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses **data and algorithms** to train models and make predictions. ML can be classified into:  

###  **1. Supervised Learning**  
- Uses **labeled data** to train models.  
- Example: **Spam Email Detection** (Emails labeled as spam or not spam).  

###  **2. Unsupervised Learning**  
- Finds patterns in **unlabeled data**.  
- Example: **Customer Segmentation** (Grouping customers based on behavior).  

###  **3. Reinforcement Learning**  
- Uses **rewards and penalties** to train models.  
- Example: **Game AI** (AlphaGo beating human players).
