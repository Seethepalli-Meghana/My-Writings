##  How Does Generative AI Work?  
Generative AI models use **machine learning techniques** like:  

1. **Deep Learning** â€“ Uses neural networks to generate complex outputs.  
2. **Transformers** â€“ Example: **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** for text generation.  
3. **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** â€“ Used for AI-generated images and deepfakes.  
4. **Diffusion Models** â€“ Used for high-quality AI-generated art (e.g., **Stable Diffusion**).
